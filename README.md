# FIRE mice project - oldest group

[**Very OLD**]{.ul}

**Done:**

-   The first cell and gene quality control is in [QC](src/QC_01_vold_jpriller)
and [QC_filtered](src/QC_01_filtered_vold_jpriller)

-   The normalisation by deconvolution in [normalise](src/normalise_01_vold_jpriller)

-   Feature selection and dimensional reduction in [feature_selection_dimred](src/fselect_dimred_01_vold_jpriller)

-   Clustering at different resolutions, [clustering_01](src/clustering_01_vold_jpriller)

-   First rough annotation [annotation_01](src/annotation_01_vold_jpriller)

Interactive [Shinyapp](https://annawilliams.shinyapps.io/shinyApp_jpriller) with the analysis until this stage.

-   Cluster QC in [clusterQC](src/cluster_QC_vold_jpriller)

-   Stricter [cell and gene QC ](src/QC_02_vold_jpriller)

-   dimensional reduction and feature selection with the cleaned data

-   Clustering with different resolutions [clustering_02](src/clustering_02_vold_jpriller)

**TO DO**

-   Annotation [annotation_02](src/annotation_02_vold_jpriller)

-   DE for each cluster

-   DA with Milo
